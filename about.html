                <p>I started my education at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA, and finished my
                    bachelor's degree in 2018 at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. My introduction
                    to coding was through Launchcode, and I've been hard at work honing my skills in this field ever
                    since.
                    Trained in Python, Java, Flask, Spring, MySQL, and many front-end tools such as Bootstrap, I've
                    since
                    been focused on strengthening my fundamentals and learning new tech such as containers, Docker, and
                    AWS.
